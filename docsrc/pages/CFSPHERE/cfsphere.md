# cloudFPGA Sphere

The **cloudFPGA Sphere** is composed of several software packages that provide all the design files required to launch an existing cloudFPGA application or create a new 
cloudFPGA application:

* cloudFPGA Developmenmt Kit (cFDK)
* cloudFPGA Resource Manager (cFRM)
  * cloudFPGA Support Package (cFSP)
  * cloudFPGA REST API (cFRAPI)
* cloudFPGA Project (cFp)
  * cloudFPGA Create (cFCreate)


[comment]: <> (cloudFPGA is designed to support different types of Shells SHELL or SHL and FPGA Modules MOD.)
[comment]: <> (Before creating a new cFp, a designer must decide for a SHELL and a MOD, both are explained in the documentation section.)
