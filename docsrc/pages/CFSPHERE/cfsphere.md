# The cloudFPGA Sphere

The **cloudFPGA Sphere** or **cFSphere** is what constitutes the core of a cloudFPGA system. 
It is composed of several major software components, each of them being provided as a standalone 
cF repository.       

* The [cloudFPGA Development Kit (cFDK)](https://github.com/cloudFPGA/cFDK) provides all the
  design files that are necessary to instantiate a cloudFPGA **SHELL** once a Shell-Role 
  architecture has been chosen by the user.
  
  * The documentation of the cFDKâ€™s API is available 
    [HERE](https://cloudfpga.github.io/Dox/index.html) in Doxygen style.
    

* The **cloudFPGA Resource Manager (cFRM)** is a software component for acquiring, distributing, 
  configuring and operating our stand-alone network-attached FPGAs in the DC infrastructure. 
  This is a complex 3-tier hierarchical architecture 
  [\[Ringlein-2019\]](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/pdf/fpga/FPL_2019.pdf) for which we provide the
  following two RESTful web APIs for a user to interact with: 
  
  * The [cloudFPGA Support Package (cFSP)](https://github.com/cloudFPGA/cFSP) is a software 
    library for accessing the control and the data path of a cloudFPGA instance.
  
  * The [cloudFPGA REST (cFREST)](https://github.com/cloudFPGA/Doc/tree/master/imgs/COMING_SOON.md) 
    is a graphical web API for the user to access the features provided by the cFRM.     
  
* The [cloudFPGA Create (cFCreate)](https://github.com/cloudFPGA/cFCreate) is a framework 
  to assist a user during the creation and the update of a cloudFPGA project.
