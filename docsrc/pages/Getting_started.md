# Getting Started

## Quick Start Guide
This quick start guide will take you through simple "_Hello World_" applications to get you started.

If you are new to _cloudFPGA_, we recommend you start with [*STEP-1-FIXME*](). otherwise, advanced 
and [*privileged user*](../pages/Overview.md#user-privilege-layers) may start from [*STEP-2-FIXME*]().

### Step-1: On-Premise Development

The _on-premise_ development flow is depicted in the 
Enabling on-premises development with Xilinx tools

NOTE: If you are developing on the AWS cloud and using AWS FPGA Developer AMI provided on AWS Marketplace, you can skip this document.

This document helps developers who choose to develop on-premises with specifying and licensing AWS-compatible Xilinx tools for use with the AWS FPGA HDK.






and clone one of the following example designs which provide a step-by-step quick start guide. 

| cFp_Project        | Description                    
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------
| cFp_Echo           | An application that echos the received UDP and TCP traffic back to the initiator node.   
| cFp_Uppercase      | An application that receives a string from a user and returns it back in uppercase. 
| cFp_Triangle       | A triangle communication example between a host and 2 FPGAs. 

cloudFPGA is designed to support different types of shells and FPGA instances. If you are a 
 _[privileged user](#privileged_user)_ who wants to contribute and collaborate at the shell design level
  or at an FPGA module level, please consider going through the following projects:
 
| cFp_Project        | Description                    
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------
| cFp_Monolithic     | A project that builds on the shell _[Kale](https://github.ibm.com/cloudFPGA/cFDK/blob/master/DOC/Kale.md)_.   
| cFp_[TODO]         | A project that uses the shell __[Themisto](https://github.ibm.com/cloudFPGA/cFDK/blob/master/DOC/Themisto.md)_.
