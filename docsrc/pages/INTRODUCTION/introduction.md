### Motivation
We built the **cloudFPGA (cF)** system because we wanted to research the use and the deployment of 
standalone network-attached FPGAs into the Cloud, but could not find such an off the shelf hardware.

Now that we have a few cF platforms up and running in our on-prem Cloud, we are offering to share 
them with other researchers around the world. Therefore, if you want to help us develop, experiment,or work with such a cluster of network-attached FPGAs, please get in touch.
