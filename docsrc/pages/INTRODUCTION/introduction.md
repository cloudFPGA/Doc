## Introduction

**cloudFPGA** is a disaggregated cloud and computing infrastructure developed at the 
[IBM Research laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/cci/cloudFPGA/).
The goal of this research platform is to deploy FPGAs at large scale in data centers.

### Motivation
We built the **cloudFPGA (cF)** system because we wanted to research the use and the deployment of 
standalone network-attached FPGAs into the Cloud, but could not find such an off the shelf hardware.

Now that we have a few cF platforms up and running in our on-premise Cloud, we are offering to 
share them with other researchers around the world. Therefore, if you want to help us develop, 
experiment, or work with such a cluster of network-attached FPGAs, please get in touch.
