Welcome to cloudFPGA documentation
==================================

**cloudFPGA** is a disaggregated data processing system based on **standalone** and **network attached** FPGAs in the **Cloud**..

For users to experiment, design and build hardware accelerated applications with cloudFPGA, we provide a
**cloudFPGA Development Kit (cFDK)** and we grant free access to instances of our **cloudFPGA Research Platform (cFRP)** in the Cloud.
