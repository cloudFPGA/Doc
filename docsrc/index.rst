Welcome to cloudFPGA documentation
==================================

**cloudFPGA** is a research platform developed at the [IBM Research, Zurich, Switzerland](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/cci/cloudFPGA/).

We built the **cloudFPGA (cF)** system because we wanted to research the use and the deployment of 
standalone network-attached FPGAs into the Cloud, but could not find such an off the shelf hardware.

Now that we have a few cF platforms up and running in our on-prem Cloud, we are willing to share 
them with other researchers around the world. Therefore, if you want to experiment, work with or 
help us develop such a cluster of network-attached FPGAs, please get in touch.
